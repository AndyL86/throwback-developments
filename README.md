# **Throwback Developments - Introduction**
Throwback Developments is a fully functioning E-Commerce store for retro vehicle parts, utilising Stripe as the payment processor. The site was built in Django using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and the Bootstrap libraries, incorporating user authentication and full CRUD functionality for the management of products. For the purposes of this project, the site does not take real card payments and a test card number has been set up:

Card number - 4242 4242 4242 4242 

Expiration date - any future date

CVC - any three-digits

Postcode or zipcode - any five-digits
